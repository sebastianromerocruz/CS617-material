### _Lecture Notes_

CS617 _Game Programming_ is a three-credit course and requires **three instructional hours per week**. These will be administered in the following way:

- **Weekly Lecture Videos**: These will be your main source of the course material, and will be released on a weekly basis through [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@Prof.RomeroCruz-ks2mx/playlists) (keep in mind that the videos themselves will be unlisted, so you will need the actual links in order to access them).

- **Lectures Notes**: In addition to these videos, I will also post text versions of the material on this repository. You will, thus, get access to all of the code that I write throughout.

You can find both of these below (scheduling is subject to small changes throughout the semester, but we don't anticipate any major changes):

- Particles
- Additional Post Processing

<br>

<a id="comp"></a>

### _Computer/Software Requirements_

You need to use either a Mac or Windows computer. You do not need a powerful machine as we are not writing anything super complicated. We will be using the [**Unity game engine**](https://unity.com/), whose personal edition you can use for free. You will also need an [**itch.io**](https://itch.io/) account!

<br>

<a id="grad"></a>

### _Grading Scheme_

All assignments (game link, description, etc.) are submitted through Classes.

#### Rubric

| **Item**                              | **Percentage** |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Project 1**                         | 15%            |
| **Project 2**                         | 15%            |
| **Project 3**                         | 15%            |
| **Project 4**                         | 15%            |
| **Final Project: _Prototype_**        | 10%            |
| **Final Project: _Playtest Results_** | 10%            |
| **Final Project: _Deliverable_**      | 20%            |

This class, while entirely project-based, does not have a large amount of rubric points. This means that any low score will have a large impact on your overall grade. Keep this in mind throughout the semester and make sure to reach out if you need anything.

There is no extra credit in this class.

#### Grading Scale

As for your final letter grade, the following scale will be used:

| **Letter Grade** | **A**  | **A-** | **B+** | **B** | **B-** | **C+** | **C** | **F** |
|------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Range**        | 93-100 | 90-92  | 87-89  | 83-86 | 80-82  | 77-79  | 70-76 | 0-69  |

<br>

<a id="deadlines"></a>

### _Deadlines_

- All projects are due at **11:59pm on Saturdays**.
    - Due by 11:59pm means your project was successfully uploaded _by that time_. This means that the version to be graded must be uploaded in both Brightspace and GitHub at that time.
    - Start uploading your project at least an hour before the deadline.
    - Projects received **1 minute late** are considered to be **a day** late.
    - The first project is due on the Friday of week 3.

- If there are any issues with uploading your project, you must email me **before the due date**.
    - While I check email regularly, do not expect a response over the weekend or close to deadlines.
    - Your code must compile. Code that does not compile will receive a grade of 0.
    - Late projects will have 10 points deducted per day. Late projects will not be accepted after 2 days.

All work is to be done on your own. There are no group projects.
**There is no additional extra credit** in this course and the grades are **not curved**.

<br>

<!-- ### _Getting Help and Slack_

If you are emailing me for help with your projects, upload your entire project to github and email me with the link 
(I need to see everything so I can help you). Do not email screenshots of your code. 

**Slack Server**: We will be using Slack to answer quick questions that you may have about the course throughout the 
summer; the join link will be provided during the first day of class. While I’m usually pretty lax in terms of behavior in our server (see: #off-topic), this server is still a university environment and should be treated as such. Be respectful to me, your course assistant, and to your fellow students. Please adhere to the following rules:

- Do not post your homework assignment code, or anybody else's, on this server. Doing so will have you automatically banned and flagged for plagiarism. You may, however, share small code blocks that don’t give away your implementation in order to ask questions.

- Please use your real first and last name as your name for easy identification.

- While we aim to be as active as possible on this server, we may not always have time to respond to a question. Please respect the team’s time as you wait for somebody to answer your question. As a student of this class, you should aim to try to answer your classmates' questions as well, instead of waiting for me to answer them every single time.

- This is a productivity server. While we encourage a relaxed atmosphere, let's stay on topic. For absolutely necessary off-topic content (it happens), post in #off-topic.

- Use #concepts-help to ask questions that pertain to the lecture material in general (i.e. not specific to a project).

- Use #projects to ask questions that pertain to the project concepts in general.

- Do NOT use this server to rant about your performance in the class. This is a professional environment, and so such behavior will result in a ban. If you would like to discuss your grades, schedule office hours with me.

- You may not invite any people outside of our class into this server.

### ChatGPT and Other Online AI Tools

As this class is being held asynchronously, it is all too easy to fall into the temptation of simply having an AI tool like ChatGPT do all your work for you, and virtually impossible for me to stop you from doing so. However, I would like to give you a fair warning that all of my assignments are run through ChatGPT and other similar tools (such as Copilot) prior to release. When I grade your assignments, the **first thing I will do is compare your projects to the AI generated ones, as well as projects found on YouTube**. If I find that your solution bears too close a similarity to any of these, **you will receive a 0 for the assignment**. 

This also applies to **writing descriptions for your games**. I'll never be asking to write an essay, so don't go getting a 0 for something as silly as this.

And don't try doing something silly like changing variable names or adding whitespace–that's the programming equivalent of changing your font size to make an essay look longer. Manage your time well, and do your own work. Your future programmer self will thank you for it.

### Academic Integrity Code

Students in this course are required to adhere to Pace University's Academic Integrity Code. The Academic Integrity Code supports honesty and ethical conduct in the educational process. It educates students about what constitutes academic misconduct, helps to deter cheating and plagiarism, and provides a procedure for handling cases of academic misconduct. Students are expected to be familiar with the Code, which can be found under "University Policies" in the [**Student Handbook**](https://www.pace.edu/student-handbook).

### University Resources and Policies

#### Procedure for Students Who Wish to Obtain Reasonable Accommodations for a Course

The University's commitment to equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations for the needs of students with disabilities. To request a reasonable accommodation for a qualified disability a student with a disability must self-identify and register with Student Accessibility Services for his or her campus. No one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need for or grant a request for an accommodation except Student Accessibility Services. Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact Student Accessibility Services on behalf of a student. For further information, please see the [**Resources for Students with Disabilities**](https://www.pace.edu/student-accessibility-services) page.

#### Technological Resources

- List of all [**Pace Information Technology Services**](https://www.pace.edu/its).

#### Appropriate Use Policy for Information Technology

Pace endorses the following statement on software and intellectual rights distributed by EDUCAUSE, the non-profit consortium of colleges and universities, committed to the use and management of information technology in higher education. The statement reads:

> _Respect for intellectual labor and creativity is vital to academic discourse and enterprise. This principle applies to work of all authors and publishers in all media. It encompasses respect for the right to acknowledgment, right to privacy and right to determine the form, manner and terms of publication and distribution._
>
> Because electronic information is volatile and easily reproduced, respect for the work and personal expression of others is especially critical in computer environments. Violations of authorial integrity, including plagiarism, invasion of privacy, unauthorized access and trade secret and copyright violations, may be grounds for sanctions against members of the academic community.

[**Pace’s appropriate use policy**](https://www.pace.edu/its/about-its/it-policies/it-appropriate-use-policy) applies to recordings of classroom instruction and digital artifacts created by faculty and students.

#### Sex-Based Misconduct Policy and Procedure

Pace University is committed to providing a safe environment for every member of its community and to ensuring that no student, faculty or staff member is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of any University program or ac:vity on the basis of sex. Accordingly, the University prohibits the following forms of Sex-Based Misconduct: sexual assault, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, da:ng violence, domes:c violence, sexual exploitation and stalking.

Instructors are a non-confidential resource and have an obligation to report any information about sexual assault with Ms. Lisa Miles, Executive Director of Institutional Equity and Title IX Coordinator (163 Williams Street, Room 1017, 212-346-1310, [**amiles@pace.edu**](mailto:amiles@pace.edu)). The Title IX/Affirmative Action Office is responsible for investigating violations of the sexual misconduct policy. For more information about the Pace University sexual misconduct policy, see the [**Sex-Based Misconduct Policy and Procedure**](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/2022-04/sexual-assault-guide.pdf) (PDF).

Members of the University community who believe that they have been subjected to Sex-Based Misconduct are encouraged to report such incidents to the University and, where applicable, to local law enforcement. **Confidential** resources include the **University Counseling Centers, Offices of Sexual and Interpersonal Wellness** and **University Healthcare**. Contact information for those offices may be found in the self-care section below.

#### Self-Care

Your academic success in this course and throughout your college career depends heavily on your personal health and well-being. Stress is a common part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected life changes outside the classroom. The Pace Community strongly encourages you to take care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of midterms and finals reach their peak. Please feel free to talk with me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. Please know there are a number of other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you. I strongly encourage you to contact them when needed.
